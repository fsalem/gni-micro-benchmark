Note, that this benchmark only works with psm2. It explicitly requests the PSM2 provider:
strcmp("psm2",info->fabric_attr->prov_name)

The build-psm2.sh script builds the test executable and runs it. Note,
that you have to change the LIBFABRIC variable in build-psm2.sh to
match you envrionment.


call:
> msub -I -l walltime=0:30:00 -l nodes=2
to start an interactive session with 2 nodes

When the session has started call:
> module load gcc
The following command will start the ping pong benchmark and report the bandwidth in the end
> ./build-psm2.sh
you have to stop the program with CTRL-c.

You can change the package size for the RMA operations in
test-psm2.cpp. At the top of the file there is a buffer_size variable.
